<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Snowmelting Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Temperature</li><li>Temperature-limited</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Constant temperature snowmelting cables are designed to continuously provide a consistent level of heat output to melt snow and ice, regardless of the ambient temperature. On the other hand, temperature-limited snowmelting cables are designed to operate only when the temperature drops below a certain threshold, usually around 40°F. Constant temperature cables are more suitable for areas with unpredictable weather conditions, while temperature-limited cables are more common in regions with milder winters where snow and ice buildup is less frequent.</p></p>
