<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Active Roll Stabilization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Actuator</li><li>Linear Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Active Roll Stabilization systems use either a rotary actuator or a linear actuator to control and minimize vehicle roll during cornering. Rotary actuators work by converting rotational motion into linear motion, providing precise control over stabilization mechanisms. Linear actuators, on the other hand, operate by extending or retracting a rod to control the movement of stabilizing components. Both types of actuators offer effective solutions for improving vehicle stability and handling, catering to different preferences and design requirements within the automotive industry.</p></p>
