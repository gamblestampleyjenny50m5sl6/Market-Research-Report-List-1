<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Etchant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrogen Peroxide</li><li>Fluoro Polymer</li><li>Hydrofluoric Acid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Titanium etchants are chemicals used to selectively remove titanium from substrate surfaces in the semiconductor industry. Three common types of titanium etchants are hydrogen peroxide, fluoro polymer, and hydrofluoric acid. </p><p>Hydrogen peroxide etchants provide a relatively mild and environmentally friendly option for titanium removal. Fluoro polymer etchants offer high selectivity and low metal contamination. Hydrofluoric acid etchants are highly effective for fast and precise titanium etching but require special handling due to their corrosive nature. Each type of etchant has different strengths and uses in the semiconductor manufacturing process.</p></p>
