<p><h1>Corneal Transplant Market Size: Global Industry Overview, Market Segmentation and Forecast (2024 to 2031)</h1></p><p><strong>Corneal Transplant Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Corneal transplant, also known as corneal grafting, is a surgical procedure that involves replacing a damaged or diseased cornea with a healthy cornea from a donor. The cornea is a clear, dome-shaped tissue located at the front of the eye, responsible for focusing light and protecting the eye from dust and germs. Corneal transplant is primarily performed to improve vision and relieve pain or discomfort caused by corneal conditions such as corneal infections, corneal scarring, corneal degeneration, or thinning of the cornea.</p><p>The global corneal transplant market is witnessing steady growth, supported by several factors. The increasing prevalence of corneal diseases, such as cataracts, infections, and keratoconus, is driving the demand for corneal transplant procedures. Additionally, advancements in surgical techniques and the availability of innovative corneal transplant products are further contributing to market growth.</p><p>Moreover, the rising geriatric population, growing awareness about eye health, and increasing healthcare expenditure are also fueling market expansion. However, the lack of availability of suitable corneal donors and the high cost of corneal transplant surgeries may hinder market growth to some extent.</p><p>In terms of market trends, the corneal transplant market is witnessing advancements in transplantation techniques, including endothelial keratoplasty and Descemet's Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK). These techniques offer advantages such as faster recovery, reduced risk of transplant rejection, and better visual outcomes. Additionally, the use of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches for corneal tissue generation is a promising area of research and development.</p><p>According to a report, the corneal transplant market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.6% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of corneal diseases and the adoption of advanced surgical techniques and products.</p></p>
