<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Motion Capture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical System</li><li>Non-Optical System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D motion capture market consists of two main types of systems: optical and non-optical. Optical systems use cameras to track markers placed on a person's body and capture their movements. These systems offer high accuracy and precision but require a controlled environment and can be expensive. Non-optical systems, on the other hand, use sensors or wearable devices to track movements without the need for cameras. While less accurate than optical systems, non-optical systems provide more flexibility and are often more cost-effective.</p></p>
