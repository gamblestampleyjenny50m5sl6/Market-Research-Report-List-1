<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deaerator Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tray-type Deaerator</li><li>Spray-type Deaerator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Deaerator systems are used in power plants and other industrial facilities to remove oxygen and other gases from feedwater before it enters the boiler. There are two main types of deaerator systems - tray-type deaerators and spray-type deaerators.</p><p>Tray-type deaerators use a series of trays to allow feedwater to come into contact with steam, promoting the release of gases. Spray-type deaerators use a nozzle to spray feedwater into a steam-filled chamber, increasing the surface area for gas removal. Both systems are effective in improving boiler efficiency and reducing corrosion.</p></p>
