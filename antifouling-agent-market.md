<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antifouling Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organotin Compounds</li><li>Biocides</li><li>Copper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antifouling agents are substances used to protect ships and other marine structures by preventing the accumulation of organisms like barnacles and algae. There are three main types of antifouling agents: organotin compounds, biocides, and copper. Organotin compounds were widely used in the past but have been largely phased out due to environmental concerns. Biocides are chemicals that can kill organisms on contact, while copper-based antifouling agents release copper ions to deter fouling organisms. Each type of antifouling agent has its own advantages and limitations in terms of effectiveness and environmental impact.</p></p>
