<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric retarders</li><li>Hydraulic retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vehicle Retarder market consists of two main types: Electric retarders and Hydraulic retarders. Electric retarders are devices that use an electric motor to generate resistance and slow down the vehicle. They are efficient and provide smooth braking, making them suitable for electric and hybrid vehicles. On the other hand, Hydraulic retarders use hydraulic fluid to generate resistance, dissipating the vehicle's energy and reducing speed. They are often used in heavy-duty vehicles due to their high braking power and ability to withstand intense heat. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing vehicle safety and control.</p></p>
