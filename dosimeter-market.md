<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dosimeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TLD Dosimeters</li><li>OSL Dosimeters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dosimeters are devices used to measure an individual's exposure to radiation. Two common types of dosimeters are Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLD) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) Dosimeters. TLD dosimeters measure radiation exposure by detecting the amount of light emitted when heated, while OSL dosimeters measure exposure by detecting the amount of light emitted when stimulated with a laser. Both types of dosimeters are widely used in industries where workers may be exposed to radiation, such as nuclear power plants and medical facilities.</p></p>
