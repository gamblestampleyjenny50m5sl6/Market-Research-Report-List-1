<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Semiconductor Inspection Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dark Field Inspection</li><li>Bright Field Inspection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical Semiconductor Inspection Equipment involves two main types of inspection methods - Dark Field Inspection and Bright Field Inspection. Dark Field Inspection illuminates the sample from the side, making defects appear bright against a dark background. This method is effective in detecting surface defects and particles. Bright Field Inspection, on the other hand, illuminates the sample from the top, making defects appear dark against a bright background. This method is more suitable for inspecting patterns and alignment issues in semiconductor manufacturing. Both methods are essential in ensuring the quality and reliability of semiconductor products.</p></p>
