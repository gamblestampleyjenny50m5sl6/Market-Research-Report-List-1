<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTCA Balloon Dilatation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Compliant</li><li>Non Compliant</li><li>Compliant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTCA Balloon Dilatation Catheters are classified into three main types: Semi-compliant, Non-compliant, and Compliant. Semi-compliant catheters are able to conform to the vessel wall with moderate pressure, making them suitable for dilating narrowed arteries without causing excessive trauma. Non-compliant catheters have a rigid balloon that does not expand significantly under pressure, allowing for higher pressure dilatation of heavily calcified lesions. Compliant catheters have a flexible balloon that expands uniformly, making them ideal for dilating more delicate or curved vessels.</p></p>
