<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capsule Endoscopy Robot Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internally Driven Type</li><li>Magnetron Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Internally Driven Type and Magnetron Type are two main types of Capsule Endoscopy Robots. Internally driven robots are compact devices with a built-in propeller system that allows them to navigate through the gastrointestinal tract independently. On the other hand, Magnetron Type robots rely on external magnetic fields to guide their movement within the body. Both types offer high-resolution imaging capabilities and provide efficient diagnosis of gastrointestinal issues. The choice of robot type depends on the specific requirements of the procedure and the preference of the healthcare provider.</p></p>
