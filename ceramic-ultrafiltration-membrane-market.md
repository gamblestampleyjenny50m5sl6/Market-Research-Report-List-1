<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Ultrafiltration Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat-sheet Membrane</li><li>Pipe Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ceramic ultrafiltration membranes are classified into two main types: flat-sheet membrane and pipe membrane. Flat-sheet membranes consist of thin, flat sheets of ceramic material, while pipe membranes are tubular in shape. Flat-sheet membranes are commonly used in applications where a large surface area is needed for filtration, such as water treatment plants. Pipe membranes, on the other hand, are often used in industries where space is limited but high filtration efficiency is required. Both types of membranes offer excellent filtration capabilities and are highly durable.</p></p>
