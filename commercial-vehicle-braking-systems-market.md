<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Braking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial Vehicle Braking Systems Market includes two main types: Drum Brake and Disc Brake. Drum Brake systems are commonly found in heavy-duty vehicles and provide cost-effective braking solutions. They operate by pushing brake shoes against the inner surface of a rotating drum. On the other hand, Disc Brake systems are known for their superior stopping power and heat dissipation capabilities. They utilize calipers to squeeze brake pads against a disc rotor to slow down or stop the vehicle efficiently.</p></p>
