<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio Methane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fermentation</li><li>Gasification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio Methane market can be divided into two main types: Fermentation and Gasification. </p><p>Fermentation refers to the process where organic materials such as agriculture waste, manure, and food waste are broken down by microorganisms to produce methane gas. This method is widely used in biogas plants to produce bio methane.</p><p>Gasification, on the other hand, involves heating organic materials in a low-oxygen environment to produce syngas, which can be further processed to produce bio methane. Gasification is often used for woody biomass and municipal solid waste.</p></p>
